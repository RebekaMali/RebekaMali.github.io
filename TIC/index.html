			<h1>Bienvenue sur ma page HTML!</h1>
			<p>Hello there! Welcome to my third “first” web page ! For this one I decided to list my favorite films and
				tv series and why I like them. If you’re watching some of them, or plan to, then SPOILER ALERT! Don’t
				come crying to me, I warned you. So let’s start…</p>
		</div>
		<h2> THE MASTERPIECE
			Gone with the wind</h2>
		<p>Well, maybe you’ve all heard of it. 8 Oscars, 4 hours, bla bla bla… But c’mon! Have you seen the characters?
			Everyone can relate to them: take Scarlett, she is in love with a man who does not even see her for her
			whole life. But let’s admit it: she’s doesn’t know Ashley, she doesn’t even see the man for who he really
			is, she has built an ideal, she has created a wonderful dress made of every virtue and quality any woman
			would desire and put it on Ashely. Well, there’s nothing wrong with this, except when you let your own
			fantasies get in the way of your happiness. And that’s where the grandeur of the film lies: it does not
			present us a princess, a woman so pure that no one can relate to, an unreachable ideal. It shows us that no
			matter how strong a person can be, we are all prone to weakness. Scarlett does not even see the happiness
			which is right there, in front of her eyes. She passes her life admiring the beautiful dress she created
			instead of seizing the moment, grabbing the rare and fleeting moments of joy and happiness life has to
			offer. One wonders, why? Is she just simple minded or is she scared that if she let real happiness get to
			her she will not be able to let it go?</p>

		<h2>THE CULT OF THE MOMENT
			The Mandalorian</h2>
		<p>What if I told you I never watched Star Wars and that this series made me watch it? We’ve all seen the memes
			on social media, Baby Yoda (no way he’s Grogu) is probably the most cute little imaginary thing ever
			created. I mean, have you seen him walking, hugging or trying to talk? I just want to grab him and hug him
			till his eyes are out. But, I think what is magical about the series is not Babe Yoda’s powers, the
			Darksaber, is the picture of what a man can do to have his kid back. We always see women in tv do the
			impossible for their kids, but it is rare seeing a man doing everything and more to save a child is not even
			his. I think my favorite part is when the Mandalorian takes his helmet down, IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE, going
			against his creed and everything he believes in just to see him again. Well, those are pretty impressive
			feelings to display on a male character.</p>


		<h2>THE FUN ONE
			Gilmore Girls
		</h2>
		<p>Let’s start with this: you cannot judge until you’ve seen it. And not just one episode, like a season. I
			admit it, it’s not the most inspiring series of all times, but there is something that soothes me when I
			watch it. There might be a good reason for it: I think what the show is trying to show us is either you have
			parents like Lorelai or you have parents like Lorelai’s. By fitting into the second category, I totally get
			her: they are always judging her, controlling her, trying to make her feel miserable so as she does what
			they want her to, why would she talk to them? Anyway, she makes the effort when her kid needs money to get a
			good education, so she just has to swallow her pride and go to Friday dinners and put up a smiling face. I
			mean I do admire her, even if she’s a fictional character : she works, she studies to get a degree, provides
			for her daughter and loves and listens to her. As far as Lorelai’s parents are concerned, I am no
			psychologist, but could it be that they know no better than the way they are behaving? Are we supposed to
			just forgive them for that? What about knowing what is right and wrong? But is there a right and wrong?</p>

		<h2>THE ROMANTIC ONE
			The Notebook </h2>
		<p>You might have seen it in tv, but he love story between Noah and Allie just melts your hearts. Contrary to
			Gone With The Wind, well this one is pretty much “unrealistic”. If you haven’t seen it this is what happens:
			Noah and Allie meet during the summer. She’s super rich and he’s penniless. Obviously her parents don’t
			approve (God maybe I have an issue with the “parents” theme) so they break up. She goes to university, about
			to marry a handsome loaded lad when she hears that her ex (Noah) built the house he promised to her when
			they were 17!! So, surprise surprise…she goes back to him, he reveals to her that he wrote to her 365 love
			letters after their breakup, so she dumps the rich lad and marries Noah. Okay, lame till now. But here is
			the thing: she gets Alzheimer’s! So, she forgets everything about him and their children. Anyway, sometimes
			“she comes back to him”, and one night (here’s my favorite part) they are together in a bed, in one of the
			rare moments she remembers him and this is their conversation: </p>
		<p>
			Allie: I need to ask you something.
			Noah: What is it, sweetheart?
			Allie: do you think that our love can create miracles?
			Noah: Yes, I do. That's what brings you back to me each time.
			Allie: Do you think our love could take us away together?
			Noah: I think our love can do anything we want it to.

		</p>
		<p>
			And guess what… apparently it is based on a true story! Don’t lose hope folks! After all, tomorrow is
			another day!
