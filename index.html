						<p>Well, maybe you’ve all heard of it. 8 Oscars, 4 hours, bla bla bla… But c’mon! Have you seen
							the
							characters? Everyone can relate to them: take Scarlett, she is in love for her whole life
							with a
							man who does not reciprocate. But let’s admit it, she doesn’t even see Ashley for who he
							really
							is, she has built an ideal, she has created a wonderful dress made of every virtue and
							quality
							any woman would desire and put it on Ashely. Well, there’s nothing wrong with this, except
							when
							you let your own fantasies get in the way of your happiness. And that’s where the grandeur
							of
							the film lies: it does not present us a princess, a woman so pure, an unreachable ideal. It
							shows us a woman prone to weakness. Scarlett does not see the happiness which is right
							there, in
							front of her eyes. She passes her life admiring the beautiful dress she has created instead
							of
							seizing the moment, grabbing the rare and fleeting moments of joy and happiness life has to
							offer. One wonders, why? Is she just simple-minded or is she scared that if she lets real
							happiness get to her she might not be able to let it go?</p>

						<h2>THE CULT OF THE MOMENT <br /><br />The Mandalorian </h2>
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
						<p>What if I told you that I never watched Star Wars and that this series made me watch it?
							We’ve all
							seen the memes on social media, Baby Yoda (no way he’s Grogu) is probably the cutest little
							imaginary thing ever created. I mean, have you seen him walking, hugging or trying to talk?
							I
							just want to grab him and hug him till his eyes are out. But, I think what is magical about
							the
							series is not Baby Yoda’s powers, the Darksaber, but rather the picture of what a man can do
							to
							have his kid back. We always see women in tv do the impossible for their kids, but it is
							rare
							seeing a man doing everything and more to save a child is not even his. I think my favorite
							part
							is when the Mandalorian takes his helmet down, IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE, going against his
							creed
							and everything he believes in just to say goodbye to him. Well, those are pretty impressive
							feelings to display on a male character.</p>

						<h2>THE FUN ONE <br /> <br />Gilmore Girls </h2>
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">
						<p>Let’s start with this: you cannot judge until you’ve seen it. And not just one episode, but
							like
							a season. I admit it, it’s not the most inspiring series of all times, but there is
							something
							that soothes me when I watch it. There might be a good reason for it: I think what the
							series is
							trying to show us is either you have parents like Lorelai, or you have parents like
							Lorelai’s.
							By fitting into the second category, I totally get her: they are always judging her,
							controlling
							her, trying to make her feel miserable so as she does what they want her to, why would she
							talk
							to them? Anyway, she makes the effort when her kid needs money to get a good education, so
							she
							just must swallow her pride and go to Friday dinners and put up a smiling face. I mean I do
							admire her, even if she’s a fictional character: she works, she studies to get a degree,
							provides for her daughter and loves and listens to her. As far as Lorelai’s parents are
							concerned, I am no psychologist, but could it be that they know no better than the way they
							are
							behaving? Are we supposed to just forgive them for that? What about knowing what is right
							and
							wrong? But is there a right and wrong when it comes to parenting?

						<h2>THE ROMANTIC ONE <br /> <br />The Notebook </h2>
						</p>
						<p class="card-text">

						<p>You might have seen it in tv, but the love story between Noah and Allie just melts your
							hearts.
							Contrary to Gone With The Wind, well this one is pretty much “unrealistic”. If you have not
							seen
							it, this is what happens: Noah and Allie meet during the summer. She’s super rich and he’s
							penniless. Obviously, her parents don’t approve (God maybe I have an issue with the
							“parents”
							theme) so they break up. She goes to university, she’s about to marry a handsome loaded lad
							when
							she hears that her ex (Noah) built the house he promised her when they were 17!! So,
							surprise
							surprise…she goes back to him, he reveals to her that he wrote to her 365 love letters after
							their breakup, so she dumps the rich lad and marries Noah. Okay, lame till now. But here’s
							the
							thing: she gets Alzheimer’s! So, she forgets everything about him and their children.
							Anyway,
							sometimes “she comes back to him”, and one night (here’s my favorite part) they are together
							in
							a bed, in one of the rare moments she remembers him, and this is their conversation: </p>
						<p>
							Allie: I need to ask you something.<br />
							Noah: What is it, sweetheart?<br />
							Allie: do you think that our love can create miracles?<br />
							Noah: Yes, I do. That's what brings you back to me each time.<br />
							Allie: Do you think our love could take us away together?<br />
							Noah: I think our love can do anything we want it to.<br />

						</p>
						<p>



							So they fall asleep and they die together! And guess what… apparently it is based on a true
							story! Don’t lose hope folks! After all, tomorrow is another day
